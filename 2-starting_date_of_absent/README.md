# Problem

 ___starting date of absent___ should be the recent ___date___ where row has ___staff_staff___ of ___Absent___. It should be the same ___date___ until before both ___staff_staff___ and ___supervisor_status___ are both ___Present___.

 When both ___staff_staff___ and ___supervisor_status___ are both ___Present___, there should be no ___date___ that is displayed.
