# Problem
If staff status is **Absent** it should search within the same column when it will be **Present** then match to supervisor status if **Present**

If the both staff and supervisor are **Present** the value of the cell should be the **DATE** during Staff and supervisor are both **Present**

If the staff is **Present** but supervisor **Absent** or **Restday** then it should search until both are **Present**
